"""Shared helpers for the tree-ensemble formulation tests.

Framework-neutral machinery for the cross-formulation agreement tests:
probing the threshold cells a solution can represent, and detecting
knife-edge ties on thresholds duplicated across trees. Each framework's
test module provides its own extraction of the per-tree
``(feature, threshold)`` pairs — using the same threshold values (and
dtype) as the MIP formulation — and its own ``predict`` evaluation.
